# v0.5.0
- Initial fork of flarfo's Save Utility released
- Markers for the boat and gems on the map are saved
- Mob spawnrate and weights are saved
- Boss rotation is saved
- Saving and reloading during a boss night does not forcibly spawn another new boss. Only one forced boss spawn will occur, at the beginning of the night, as is the case in vanilla. More bosses may still spawn by random chance during nighttime
- Chief, if currently spawned, is saved (just like Big Chunk, Gronk, and Guardians)
- Furnaces start smelting on game load (unsure if works in multiplayer)
- You cannot save when leaving the island
- You cannot save if everybody is dead
