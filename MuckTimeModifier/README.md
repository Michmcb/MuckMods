# What It Does
This plugin allows you to control the speed of time and the length of the daytime and nighttime portions of a day cycle. You can make days last longer, go by faster, have a longer period of daytime, or make nights last for ages!

# Configurable
When running Muck for the first time with this plugin installed, MuckTimeModifier.MichMcb.cfg will be created in the BepinEx/config folder.
The configurable aspects of this plugin are:

- The length multiplier for a day cycle. For example, 1.25 makes daytime last 25% longer. Note that the base length of a day cycle varies slightly depending upon difficulty; harder difficulties have shorter days.
- The speed at which time progresses during nighttime. In vanilla, Muck increases the speed of time by 3.3 at night.
- The speed at which time flows. For example, 2 makes days last twice as long. (Because time flows at the speed of 0.1, and 0.1 / 2 = 0.05)
- How frequently boss days occur on Easy, Normal, and Gamer difficulty
