# What It Does
This plugin allows you to change the Powerup loot tables. You can completely remove undesirable powerups from dropping, increase the frequency of powerups you want lots of, or completely change loot tables.
There are three loot tables: White, Blue, and Orange. They correspond to the coloured highlights around powerups. This plugin affects powerups dropped from chests and from bosses.

# Configurable
When running Muck for the first time with this plugin installed, MuckConfigurePowerupDrops.cfg will be created in the BepinEx/config folder.
The configurable aspects of this plugin are:

- Powerups that are in the white, blue, and orange loot tables
- The relative frequency at which specific powerups will drop
