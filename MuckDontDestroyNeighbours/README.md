# What It Does
This plugin simply prevents your entire base spontaneously combusting as soon as you (or an enemy) dare break a single wooden floor/wall/stairs.

Serious explanation: When a single structure component is destroyed, such as stairs, a wall, floor, roof, etc., normally all adjacent non-grounded components are also destroyed. Which leads to the problem of, for example, a skybase being completely destroyed as soon as any part of stairs which lead up to it break.
This plugin prevents that from happening. You (or enemies) can break whatever structure components you like, and nothing else will be destroyed due to no support. This greatly simplifies repairs, and no more stressing about boss nights breaking your entire base!
