# What It Does
This plugin allows you to craft arrows out of more materials, and configure the attack power of all arrows in the game.
By default, Flint/Steel/Mithril/Adamantite arrows are slightly weakened. Obamium Arrows are stronger.


# Configurable
When running Muck for the first time with this plugin installed, MuckArrows.MichMcb.cfg will be created in the BepinEx/config folder.
The configurable aspects of this plugin are:

- Whether or not Stone/Obamium/Ruby/Chunkium arrows can be crafted (does remove the items in-game)
- The damage of all types of arrow in the game
