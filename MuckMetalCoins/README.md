# What It Does
This plugin allows you to craft coins out of metal bars at an Anvil. By default, you can make coins out of all metals: Iron, Mithril, Adamantite, Obamium, and Chunkium, but you can add recipes for any item you wish.
You can also modify the number of coins which Gold Bars make, too.

# Configurable
When running Muck for the first time with this plugin installed, MuckMetalCoins.MichMcb.cfg will be created in the BepinEx/config folder.
The configurable aspects of this plugin are:

- The items from which coins can be crafted
- The number of items required to craft coins (e.g. 2 Iron Bars = 1 Coin)
- The number of coins you get from crafting (e.g. 2 Iron Bars = 3 Coins)
- Number of gold bars required to craft coins, and the number of obtained from crafting
